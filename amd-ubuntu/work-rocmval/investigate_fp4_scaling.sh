# Investigate the fp4 GPU-count scaling anomaly found in the first gst sweep
# (results/rvs_tflops.md, N=8 per-GPU spread up to 63% vs <1% for every other precision,
# including fp6/bf6 at the same 10,000 TFLOPS peak class and the same MX block-scaling
# mechanism). That pattern rules out ordinary shared power/thermal budget as the sole
# explanation -- power capping depresses every die roughly equally, not one die at ~99% of
# solo peak next to another at <40%.
#
# This script does NOT explain the anomaly by itself. It gathers the two things the first
# sweep did not capture, so a human (or a follow-up analysis pass) can actually distinguish
# the competing hypotheses:
#   1. Per-GPU clock/power telemetry sampled DURING each run, at 2 s resolution, via
#      `rocm-smi --showclocks --showpower`. If low performers show depressed clocks
#      alongside their low GFLOPS, that is evidence for a real thermal/power/silicon cause.
#      If clocks look normal while GFLOPS is low, that points at a measurement or
#      launch/scheduling artifact in RVS's parallel gst path instead.
#   2. THREE repeats at each of N=5,6,7,8 (fp4 only; N=1..4 were clean in the first sweep
#      and are not repeated here). If the same GPU ID is consistently the low performer
#      across repeats, that is a deterministic, hardware- or topology-correlated effect.
#      If the low performer changes between repeats, that points at non-determinism in the
#      launch/sync path -- a software bug, not a die.
#
# Usage: ./investigate_fp4_scaling.sh
# Runtime: ~15-20 min (4 GPU-counts x 3 repeats x ~30 s gst duration, plus RVS overhead).
