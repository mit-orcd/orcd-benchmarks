"""Aggregate RVS gst sweeps into results/rvs_tflops.{md,csv}.

Usage: analyze_rvs.py <sweep_dir> [<sweep_dir> ...] -o <results_dir>

Emits a summary with the same information as dell-cloud/work-rocmval/summary.md +
summary-sweep.md: hardware specs, measured TFLOPS with per-N scaling efficiency,
measured-vs-dense-peak, per-GPU spread, the B200 comparison, and auto-generated
observations. Narrative verdicts are left to results/SUMMARY.md.

Reads each run dir's summary.csv (written by run_tflops.sh, columns:
gpus,precision,per_gpu_peak_tflops,aggregate_tflops,gpus_reporting -- already in
TFLOPS); if absent, re-parses the raw <n>x_<prec>.log files.

          "FP6 at FP8 rate). If that claim does not hold for this silicon/stack, the correct "

          "peak. Either way it is the worst precision measured, and either way fp6 being "
          "absolutely slower than fp8 is the anomaly worth explaining. This is flagged "
