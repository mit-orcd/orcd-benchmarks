"""Aggregate ATOM serving sweeps into results/atom.{md,csv}.

Usage: analyze_atom.py <sweep_dir> [<sweep_dir> ...] -o <results_dir>

One section per model, plus a cross-model comparison. Grouping by model matters: the
per-concurrency JSON records `model_id` as the container mount path (`/model`) for every
tier, so without recovering the real name from the sweep's summary.txt all three tiers
collapse into one undifferentiated table and the knee detection compares an 8B model's
latency against a 2.78T model's.
