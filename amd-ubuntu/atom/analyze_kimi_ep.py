Usage: analyze_kimi_ep.py <ep_sweep_dir> <baseline_sweep_dir> <kimi-k3-base.md>

Idempotent: the block is delimited by HTML comment markers and replaced on re-run.
Interprets the result against the bandwidth hypothesis in section 3/5 rather than just
dumping numbers -- EP is predicted to help because it trades HBM traffic (~29% utilized)
for all-to-all over an idle interconnect (~1% utilized).
