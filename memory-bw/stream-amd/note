# description
The STREAM benchmark is a simple, synthetic benchmark program that measures sustainable main memory bandwidth in MB/s and the corresponding computation rate for simple vector kernels.

The general rule for running STREAM is that each array must be at least 4x the size of the sum of all the last-level caches used in the run, or 1 million elements, whichever is larger. 

STREAM uses four kernels for analysis:

"Copy'' measures transfer rates in the absence of arithmetic.
"Scale'' adds a simple arithmetic operation.
"Sum'' adds a third operand to allow multiple load/store ports on vector machines to be tested.
"Triad'' allows chained/overlapped/fused multiply/add operations.
